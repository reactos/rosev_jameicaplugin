<form>
	<p>
		<span color="header" font="header">Public Donation List</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		This list shows all incoming donations derived from JVerein's booking list and the table containing additionally added ones.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You can add additional donations independent of the booking list by using the button <b>New additional donation</b>. This can be
		useful for listing donations to another ReactOS entity or donations older than the foundation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The checkbox <b>Show invalid donations only</b> shows all donations with an amount of 0. This can happen for example if a JVerein
		booking has no donation amount or if it has been entered wrongly.
